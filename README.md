# Memory_game_in_C++
A pattern-based fun memory game built with C++ and SFML, incorporating fundamental data structure concepts. 

**How to play**
• A pattern is generated and displayed on the screen for a short duration.

• Memorize the sequence before it disappears.

• Recreate the pattern in the exact order by selecting the correct tiles.

• If the pattern is incorrect, an error will be displayed.

• Progress through levels by correctly replicating the sequence.

**Modes**
• Easy - 5x5 grid, slower pattern disappearance.

• Medium – 6x6 grid, moderate pattern speed.

• Hard – 7x7 grid, fast-disappearing pattern.

**Features**
• Built with C++ and SFML – Ensures smooth graphics and animations.

• Queue Data Structure – Patterns must be recreated in the correct order.

• Grid Implemented with 2D Arrays – Efficient storage and manipulation of tiles.

• Dynamic Difficulty Scaling – Increasing complexity across three levels.

• User-Friendly Interface – Simple yet engaging design.

• Tile Animations – Enhances the visual experience.
